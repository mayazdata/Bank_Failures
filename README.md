# Bank_Failures
Where and when do banks fail the most?
This is the summary of a project I did in my Econometrics class. 
I retrieved data from FDICâ€™s website, 
which is a government website to insure the data integrity. 
Then I utilized SAS to input and analyzed the data to calculate frequencies and percentages, 
also, I used PROC GMAP to visualize the findings.
